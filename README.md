# Normie's Cipher Machines
This winter, I am starting a project where I attempt to reconstruct the logic of various electromechanical cipher machines, most of which were used during World War II.

## List of machines
This is a (tentative) list of machines I aim to implement during the project:

*Note: This list is subject to change. I may add or remove machines depending on whether I think it is feasible to reconstruct the machine.*
- Enigma
  - Model M3
  - Model M4
  - Model G31 (Ch.15a)
  - Model Swiss-K
- T-52
  - Model a/b
  - Model c/ca
  - Model d
  - Model e
- Lorenz
  - Model SZ-40
  - Model SZ-42a
  - Model SZ-42b
  - Model SZ-42c
- Typex
- Sigaba
